# KukusRandomEvent_GangShootandRunThru
 A random event that occours throughout Los santos near player where ballas and groves fight and then hijak the nearest car and run away
Feautures:
1. Ballas and Groves spawning in distance, you will hear the gun fight, be notified of the war and have blips on your map.
2. They will take down anyone in their path including peds who try to fight as well as police.
3. Groves are your allies and won't hurt you, where as ballas are neutral and will attack you if you attack them.

Plans:
1. Adding police responding to the war and reaching after certain time, Gang failing to run away within the time shall have to fight the tanky armed cops.
2. If no cars are nearby then they will call and a gang member will come to pick them up.

FUTURE MODS PLAN:
1. Peds Wanted Priority:- Hated that the Law only cared about taking you down but not the peds? This mod will send backup units to the peds who are fighting with the cops. Should be interesting.
2. BodyGuards who you will be able to command such as taking you to destination, following you with another car,healing you etc
3. Call police mod. The default phone call isnt good enough for me. I want more action!
